# Coordination DAO

to enable CORS, change the `FRONTEND_URL` in `/api` & `VITE_API_URL` in `/webapp`

in most cases they should be:

`VITE_API_URL`=http://localhost:3000
`FRONTEND_URL`=http://localhost:5173

## Note to myself

TODO

- fix form errors, uncontrolled to controlled
- update toast when transaction is successful
- refactor error messages
- improve contract reading code
